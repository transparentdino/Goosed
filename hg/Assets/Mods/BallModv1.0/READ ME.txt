Thank you for downloading my mod.

This mod adds a ball to the dekstop for you and the goose to play with.
The goose will randomly charge at and kick the ball.
You can also kick the ball by touching it with the mouse. Doing so will cause the goose to come kick it.

The ball can be topggled on and off by placing the mouse cursor in the very top left of the display.

 For any help, info, suggestions I can be reached on discord at TheOrlando#9984
